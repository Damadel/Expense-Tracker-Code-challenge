# Expense Tracker

This is a simple expense tracker I built using React. It allows users to add and search through a
 list of expenses with basic form inputs and real-time updates.

## What I Used

- **React** â€“ to create components and handle state.
- **useState** â€“ for managing form inputs, expense list, and search field.
- **Basic CSS** â€“ for layout, spacing, and table styling.
- **Vite** â€“ for fast project setup and development.
